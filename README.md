# SOUNID
Ominira Tech presents Social Unique ID, a solution that aims to provide a unique identification for profiles on traditional Web2 social networks and anticipate future demands of Web3 networks through a dApp. Users can register their profiles on the social network and have them validated through Blockchain. One challenge faced by social media users is the unification of profiles. Often, a username is only available on one network, making it difficult to associate profiles from the same person. With SOUNID, users can associate their accounts as a unique identity. Even if a profile tries to impersonate a user from another network using the same username, the unique identity will ensure that the profile doesn't belong to the owner of that username on another network, providing more security. Besides being a tool for future use in Web3, it helps popularize Blockchain technology in Web2 and demonstrates its vast utility for regular users.

It will soon be possible to follow updates on the projectâ€™s construction here.
